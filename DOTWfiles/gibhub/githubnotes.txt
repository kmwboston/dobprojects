committing:

a snap shot of your files as they are, at a point in time, before they are manipulated
*first step is to add the files to tell git knows what to commit
*second step we have to sync them back up to the server (called a 'push')

1.ADD
2.COMMIT
3.PUSH

-git add README.md
adding the files we want to commit
-git commit -m 'Adding README'
the -m is a message, we must add the messege for it to be committed
-git remote add origin 'complete url here'
this links what you've done locally to the repository online (but doesn't actually send it)
-git remote -v
gives validation about what you've done (will show the fetch and push)
-git push origin master
this actually puts the linked repository on the web (github.com)

lets do the process again:
-git add README.md
-git commit -m 'Changing README'4:18 PM 3/5/2014/
-git push origin master

TO FORK:
take link of what you want to fork
-git clone (url).git *INCLUDE .git
clones file
-cd SPoon-Knife
check if you're in the right place
-git add index.html
adds the changes you made to the html
-git commit -m "changing web page title"
now it commits it to the github repository
-git push origin master
uploads to github
